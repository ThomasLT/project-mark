<h2>Warehouse Functions</h2>
<p>The Warehousing and Storage activity can represent a number of different functions with the supply chain operation which include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inventory Holding: holds goods and commodities often referred to as inventory, which will be released into the supply chain process based on the demand dynamics of the market it serves.</li>
	</li>Consolidation: in such instances other products are received at the warehouse facility and are amalgamated with the inventory already on hand in their respective storage system.</li>
	</li>Cross â€“ Docking: the warehouse function acts as a short term transit point for the goods and commodities moving through the supply chain whereby these are received at the goods-in section of the warehouse before being moved directly to the dispatching goods-out area.  In this function the goods do not enter into the warehouses inventory system or recognised as a stock holding item.</li>
	</li>Sortation Centre: similar in nature to both cross docking and consolidation process in that good are received at the warehouse and are sorted in to a geographical area or even to a customer dependent on the nature of the product, or distribution type.</li>
</ul>
