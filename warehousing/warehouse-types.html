<h2>Warehouse Types</h2>
<p>There are some specialist types of warehouse facilities that can be found with a supply chain whereby the SCM process holds a high degree of complexity or specialist knowledge.</p>
<li>Bonded Warehouse: this facility holds imported goods that are subject to incurring duty or taxation to the importer.  This kind of warehouse is controlled through a high level of security and is often visited by Her Majesty Revenue and Customs (HMRC) who check the facility to ensure the inventory is correctly stored and recorded.  The warehouse facilitates the payment of duty and taxation to HMRC when the inventory is requested by the customer.  Some of the large retail organisations in the UK operate through this system where for example; their wines and spirits are held centrally, before being distributed to either other warehouses or to their stores.  Bonded Warehouse facilities that hold alcohol are often referred to as Wet Bonded Warehouses, and in cases where tobacco is the main inventory, they are often referred to as a Dry Bonded Warehouse.</li>
<li>Cold Storage: most common in the meat trade where the inventory needs to be held at a specified temperature in order to maintain product quality and also meet food health standards. Such storage facilities are normally used for imported meat products whereby a large quantities are received at any one time.  Meat arriving in the UK from South America can be moved from the point of entry into the country, to a temperature controlled holding area direct from the temperature controlled containers that have been used to house the product from the country of origin.</li>
<li>Hazardous Storage: Products such as chemicals, corrosive and flammable liquids need to be stored in specially designed containers throughout the supply chain process. In some cases special licences have to be acquired in order for the warehouse hold such products.  Health & Safety compliance is an imperative part of this storage operation whereby in extreme circumstances, the operation is subject to government inspection process.</li>
