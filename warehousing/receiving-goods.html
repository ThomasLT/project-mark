Vendors deliver purchased goods to the operating location receiving office or directly to the 
project director. The goods are usually delivered all at once,

bill of lading, as well as the description on the related purchase order. Major discrepancies can lead to 
rejection of the delivered goods. If there is no authorizing purchase order and the purchasing manager 
does not issue a waiver, reject the delivered goods. Use a preprinted receiving checklist to inspect
