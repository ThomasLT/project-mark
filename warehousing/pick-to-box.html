<h2>Preparing and Despatch</h2>
<p>Pick to box is similar to the sorting solution as it uses the same elements; a picking area, a storage
area, replenishment of the picking area and a sorter. The picking area is organized so that there are a
number of picking zones connected by a conveyor system. The operator fills the box with the items on
a customer order and the box moves to the picking zones until the customer order is complete and it is
then ready for shipment to the customer. The efficiencies are gained because the operator does not
have to consume time collecting individual items, but the cost of the initial set up of this solution
could negate any <a herf="http://management.about.com/cs/money/a/CostBenefit.htm" target="_blank">cost benefits</a> that the solution offers.Choosing an order picking system depends on
any number of requirements such as cost, complexity, number of customer orders, size and number of
items, etc. Every company has a unique requirement and one order picking solution may suit one
business and not another. Determining the requirements will ensure that the most efficient order
picking solution is selected.</p>
