<h2>Driver cards and records</h2>
<p>It is a legal requirement for a digital tachograph-equipped vehicle driven in scope of EU rules that the driver must use a driver card.If the vehicle is used without a card being inserted, the system will not prevent the vehicle from being driven, but the VU will record the fact that the vehicle has been used without a card.Drivers may only be in possession of one driver’s smart card, and must never use anyone else’s card or allow another driver to use their card.When driving a vehicle that is equipped with a digital tachograph, drivers should you ensure that the instrument is calibrated by inspecting the calibration plaque or interrogating the instrument; you ensure that their driver card is inserted into the correct slot (driver in slot 1, second driver in slot 2 from the moment they take over the vehicle, and that it is ready for use, before the vehicle is moved.</p>
