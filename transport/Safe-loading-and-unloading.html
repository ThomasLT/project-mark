<h2>Safe loading and unloading</h2>
<p>Loading and unloading vehicles can be dangerous with a whole host of potential hazards such as  people or loads falling from vehicles, people being struck by a load during mechanical handling or  people being struck by vehicles. Employers have a legal duty to ensure that the health and safety of their employees, contractors and members of the public are not put at risk as a result of the work they do.</p>
<p>To help Minimise these risks, employers can follow a simple four-step best practice process as a guide to successfully managing safety when working at height: </p>

<ol>
    <li><span>Plan to avoid work at height where possible</span></li>
    <li><span>If this is not possible, use work equipment to prevent falls, with the first choice being vehicle-based systems and second choice on-site systems</span></li>
    <li><span>Where the risk of a fall canâ€™t be eliminated, use work equipment to Minimise the distance and consequences of a fall</span></li>
    <li><span>Always consider measures that protect everyone at risk (e.g. platforms and guardrails) before measures that only protect the individual (e.g. safety harness)</span></li>
</ol>
