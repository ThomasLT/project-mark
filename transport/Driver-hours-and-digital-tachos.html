<h2>Drivers Hours and Digital Tachos</h2>
<p>The EU rules (Regulation (EC) 561/2006) apply to drivers of most vehicles used for the carriage of goods - defined as goods or burden of any description - (including dual purpose vehicles) where the maximum permissible weight of the vehicle, including any trailer or semi-trailer, exceeds 3.5 tonnes and where the vehicle is used within the UK or between the UK and other EU and EEA countries and Switzerland. Vehicle operations that take place off the public road or vehicles that are never used to carry goods on a public road are out of scope. Additionally drivers who never carry goods or passengers in the course of their employment are not considered to be within scope of the regulations. For example, this covers operations such as the delivery and recovery of hire vehicles and empty vehicles taken for annual test</p>
<h2>Digital tachographs</h2>
<p>These work by storing digital data on the driver and vehicle in their own memory and separately on a driverâ€™s smart card. Transport undertakings must periodically download this data from the digital tachograph (known as the Vehicle Unit or VU) every 56 days and from driver cards every 28 days and analyse the information to ensure that the rules have been complied with.</p>
